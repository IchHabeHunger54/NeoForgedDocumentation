Method Reference
================

This article is a reference for all protected or public methods in various block-related classes.

`Block`
-------

:::note
Some of these methods are actually located in `BlockBehaviour`, the abstract superclass of `Block`, or in `IForgeBlock`, a NeoForge-added interface implemented by `Block` that adds extra utilities for modders to the `Block` class. However, for all our intents and purposes, we can treat them as if they were located in `Block` itself.

| `public static Block byItem(@Nullable Item)`                                                                                    | If the given item is a `BlockItem`, that `BlockItem`'s block is returned. Otherwise, `Blocks.AIR` is returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `public static VoxelShape box(double, double, double, double, double, double)`                                                  | Creates a `VoxelShape` with the given corner points. Parameter order is x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2. The unit used is single pixels, or in other words, 1 / 16 of a block. So for example, if you want a shape that is exactly one pixel tall, you'd use `box(0, 0, 0, 16, 1, 16);`.                                                                                                                                        |
| `public static BlockState updateOrDestroy(BlockState, BlockState, LevelAccessor, BlockPos, int, int)`                           | Replaces the old blockstate (first parameter) with the new blockstate (second parameter) in the given level at the given position. The first `int` parameter is the update flags (see [Using Level#setBlock][setblock] for more information). The second `int` parameter is the amount of leftover worldgen recursions. It is recommended to use the overload that omits this parameter if you are not doing worldgen. |
| `public static BlockState updateOrDestroy(BlockState, BlockState, LevelAccessor, BlockPos, int)`                                | Overload of `updateOrDestroy(BlockState, BlockState, LevelAccessor, BlockPos, int, int)` that uses the default recursion amount of 512 as the second int parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `public static BlockState pushEntitiesUp(BlockState, BlockState, LevelAccessor, BlockPos)`                                      | Helper method that pushes entities out of the second `BlockState`'s bounds (if it is greater than the first `BlockState`'s bounds). Used in scenarios such as when farmland turns back into dirt and consequently has its shape increased back to a full block.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `public static BlockState updateFromNeighbourShapes(BlockState, LevelAccessor, BlockPos)`                                       | With the provided `BlockState`, performs neighbor checks for all neighboring blocks in the given level at the given position. Used for example by Endermen when they place down a block they are holding.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `public static boolean isExceptionForConnection(BlockState)`                                                                    | Whether the given state is an exception for connection by fences, walls and iron bars. If `true`, these blocks will not connect with the given state, even if they would connect otherwise. `true` for all types of Leaves, all types of Shulker Boxes, Barriers, Carved Pumpkins, Jack o'Lanterns, Melons and Pumpkins.                                                                                               |
| `public static boolean shouldRenderFace(BlockState, BlockGetter, BlockPos, Direction, BlockPos)`                                | Calculates whether the given blockstate's face in the given direction should be rendered or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `public static boolean canSupportRigidBlocks(BlockGetter, BlockPos)`                                                            | Whether the state at the given position in the given level can support a rigid block or not. Rigid blocks are blocks like rails or pressure plates that require only a solid top face to be placed, so using this method means that they can also be placed on non-full blocks that have a full solid top face, for example a top slab.                                                                                |
| `public static boolean canSupportCenter(BlockGetter, BlockPos, Direction)`                                                      | Whether the state at the given position in the given level can support a center block in the given direction or not. Center blocks are blocks that require a solid center, but can be placed on blocks that do not have a full face in that direction. Prime examples would be a torch or a candle placed on a fence, or a lantern or a bell placed on the bottom face of a fence.                                     |
| `public static int getId(@Nullable BlockState)`                                                                                 | Returns the numerical ID of a blockstate by performing a lookup in the blockstate registry. The parameter may be `null`, in which case 0 is returned. Used for networking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `public static BlockState stateById(int)`                                                                                       | Counterpart of `getId`, returns the blockstate associated with the given integer by performing a lookup in the blockstate registry. If the given integer does not correspond to a blockstate, `Blocks.AIR.defaultBlockState()` is returned instead. Used for networking.                                                                                                                                               |
| `public static boolean isFaceFull(VoxelShape, Direction)`                                                                       | Whether the given shape is a full shape in the given direction or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `public static boolean isShapeFullBlock(VoxelShape)`                                                                            | Whether the given shape is a full 1x1x1 block shape or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `public static List<ItemStack> getDrops(BlockState, ServerLevel, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity)`                              | Rolls the loot table for the given blockstate and returns the results as a `List<ItemStack>`. Includes the position context, the block entity context if the block entity parameter is not `null`, and an empty tool context when rolling the loot table.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `public static List<ItemStack> getDrops(BlockState, ServerLevel, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity, @Nullable Entity, ItemStack)` | Alternative variant of `getDrops(BlockState, ServerLevel, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity)` that additionally includes entity context if the entity is not `null`, and tool context using the given `ItemStack` when rolling the loot table.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `public static void dropResources(BlockState, Level, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity)`                                          | Generates drops by calling `getDrops(BlockState, ServerLevel, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity)` and drops them in the level as item entities. Also calls `BlockState#spawnAfterBreak(ServerLevel, BlockPos, ItemStack, boolean)` with `ItemStack.EMPTY` and `true` for the last two parameters.                                                                                                                        |

Equivalent to calling `dropResources(BlockState, Level, BlockPos, null)` with the same first three parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `public static void dropResources(BlockState, Level, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity, @Nullable Entity, ItemStack, boolean)`    | Generates drops by calling `getDrops(BlockState, ServerLevel, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity, @Nullable Entity, ItemStack)` and drops them in the level as item entities. Also calls `BlockState#spawnAfterBreak(ServerLevel, BlockPos, ItemStack, boolean)` with the corresponding parameters of this method.                                                                                                        |
| `public static void dropResources(BlockState, Level, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity, @Nullable Entity, ItemStack)`             | Alternative variant of `dropResources(BlockState, Level, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity, @Nullable Entity, ItemStack, boolean)` that omits the boolean parameter. Equivalent to calling `dropResources(BlockState, Level, BlockPos, @Nullable BlockEntity, @Nullable Entity, ItemStack, true)` with the same first six parameters.                                                                                    |

| `public void handlePrecipitation(BlockState, Level, BlockPos, Biome.Precipitation)`                     | Called with a 1 in 16 chance when it is raining to handle weather-dependent behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `public BlockState getStateForPlacement(BlockPlaceContext)`                                             | Called when trying to place a `BlockItem` of this block down. The given `BlockPlaceContext` contains information such as the level, the position, the player, the stack and many more that can be used to determine the result. Returns the default block state, but is overridden in a wide range of places. For example, fences use this method to connect to other blocks when placing.                                         |
| `public void setPlacedBy(Level, BlockPos, BlockState, @Nullable LivingEntity, ItemStack)`               | Called **after** the blockstate has been placed down by the given `LivingEntity`. Overridden for example by player heads to fetch the associated player skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `public void playerWillDestroy(Level, BlockPos, BlockState, Player)`                                    | Called immediately **before** the blockstate will be destroyed by the given player. Called regardless of whether the player is using the correct tool. By default, this spawns breaking particles and angers piglins if applicable. Overridden in various places for additional behavior, for example by doors to break their upper/lower part as well.                                                                            |
| `public void destroy(LevelAcccessor, BlockPos, BlockState)`                                             | Called **after** the blockstate has been destroyed by the player. Used by pistons to destroy the piston head as well if they are activated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `public void playerDestroy(Level, Player, BlockPos, BlockState, @Nullable BlockEntity, ItemStack)`      | Called **after** the given player has destroyed the given blockstate with the given tool at the given position in the given level. Called only if the block has used a sufficient tool for drops to spawn, so for example, this will not be called when breaking diamond ore with a wooden pickaxe. Default behaviour handles resource dropping. Overridden for example by beehives that spawn bees in this method when destroyed. |
| `protected void spawnDestroyParticles(Level, Player, BlockPos, BlockState)`                             | Sends a packet to the client to spawn breaking particles there. Overridden to no-op by fire blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `public void popExperience(ServerLevel, BlockPos, int)`                                                 | Drops the given amount of experience in the given level at the given position. Respects the `doTileDrops` gamerule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `protected void tryDropExperience(ServerLevel, BlockPos, ItemStack, IntProvider)`                       | Helper method for dropping experience if the given `ItemStack` is not enchanted with Silk Touch. Currently unused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `public void stepOn(Level, BlockPos, BlockState, Entity)`                                               | Called when an entity stands on this blockstate. Used for example by magma blocks to apply magma damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `public void fallOn(Level, BlockState, BlockPos, Entity, float)`                                        | Called when an entity falls onto this blockstate from the given distance. Default behavior is to cause fall damage. Overridden by various blocks that modify fall damage, for example beds or pointed dripstone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This method is mainly responsible for handling the given entity's movement after falling on the block. Default behavior is to cancel any vertical movement. Overridden by beds and slime blocks to perform their bouncing behavior.                                                                                                         |
| `public boolean propagatesSkylightDown(BlockState, BlockGetter, BlockPos)`                              | Whether this block propagates skylight through itself or not. By default, this returns `true` if the block is not a full block and has no fluid state. However, this is overridden by several blocks, such as glass which always let light pass through it.                                                                                                                                                                        |

Default behaviour is to return `true` if the blockstate is not solid and not a liquid. Overridden by banners, pressure plates and signs to return `true` despite being solid.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `public void appendHoverText(ItemStack, @Nullable BlockGetter, List<Component>, TooltipFlag)`           | Called by the method of the same name in `Item`, this method is responsible for appending hover texts (tooltips) to the item. Does nothing by default. Overridden for example by shulker boxes that add their content tooltips here.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `public boolean canSustainPlant(BlockState, BlockGetter, BlockPos, Direction, IPlantable)`              | Whether this blockstate can sustain the given plant, in the form of an `IPlantable`. Note that this system is flawed and will likely be replaced with a better system in the future. NeoForge-added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

`BlockState`
------------

:::note
Some of these methods are actually located in `BlockBehaviour.BlockStateBase`, the abstract superclass of `BlockState`, or in `IForgeBlockState`, a NeoForge-added interface implemented by `Block` that adds extra utilities for modders to the `BlockState` class. However, for all our intents and purposes, we can treat them as if they were located in `BlockState` itself.

### Static methods

| Method                                          | Description                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `public static Properties of()`                 | Returns a new `Properties` object with default values.                                |
| `public static Properties copy(BlockBehaviour)` | Returns a new `Properties` object with the values used by the given `BlockBehaviour`. |

### Instance methods

All instance methods of `Properties` are `public` and return themselves (`return this;`). As a result, all the below methods can be chained at will; that is, appended in whatever order you like. An example from the `Blocks` class best shows this:
```java
public static final Block OAK_PLANKS = register("oak_planks", new Block(BlockBehaviour.Properties.of()
        .mapColor(MapColor.WOOD)
        .instrument(NoteBlockInstrument.BASS)
        .strength(2.0F, 3.0F)
        .sound(SoundType.WOOD)
        .ignitedByLava()
));

| `air()`                                               | Tells the game to consider the block as air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `destroyTime(float)`                                  | Sets the block's destroy time. Default value is 0. Typical values include 1.5 for stone, 0.5 for dirt, 50 for obsidian, and -1 for unbreakable blocks such as bedrock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `explosionResistance(float)`                          | Sets the block's explosion resistance. Default value is 0. Typical values include 6 for stone, 0.5 for dirt, 1200 for obsidian, and 3600000 for unbreakable blocks such as bedrock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `strength(float, float)`                              | Sets the block's destroy time (first parameter) and explosion resistance (second parameter). Equivalent to calling `.destroyTime(float).explosionResistance(float)` with the same parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `strength(float)`                                     | Sets the block's destroy time and explosion resistance. Equivalent to calling `.destroyTime(float).explosionResistance(float)` with the same parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `instabreak()`                                        | Sets the block's destroy time and explosion resistance to 0. Equivalent to calling `.destroyTime(0).explosionResistance(0)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `requiresCorrectToolForDrops()`                       | Sets the block to require the correct tool in order to drop anything. If false, the correct tool will mine faster, but items will drop regardless of what tool was used. `true` for blocks like stone or the various ores, `false` for blocks like planks or dirt.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `noLootTable()`                                       | Sets the block to not use a loot table, causing the block to not drop anything. Note that no drops can also be achieved by using an empty loot table instead of no loot table at all, so only use this where applicable. Vanilla uses include unobtainable blocks (bedrock, barriers, etc.) and fluids (water/lava blocks).                                                                                            |
| `dropsLike(Block)`                                    | **DEPRECATED: Use `lootFrom` instead!** Sets the block to use the given block's loot table instead of its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `lootFrom(Supplier<Block>)`                           | Sets the block to use the given block's loot table instead of its own. Uses a `Supplier` to allow directly passing in `RegistryObject`s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `noParticlesOnBreak()`                                | Disables breaking particles for the block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `replaceable()`                                       | Enables the block to be replaceable by other blocks. This is relevant when trying to place a block into another blocks. For example, grass is replaceable, while flowers are not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `friction(float)`                                     | Sets the block's friction (slipperiness) value. Default friction value is 0.6, Ice, Packed Ice and Frosted Ice use 0.98, Blue Ice uses 0.989, and Slime Blocks use 0.8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `speedFactor(float)`                                  | Sets the block's speed factor. Entities that walk over the block will be slowed (if < 1) or sped up (if > 1) by this value. Default speed factor is 1, Soul Sand and Honey Blocks use 0.4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `jumpFactor(float)`                                   | Sets the block's jump factor. Entities that jump while standing on this block will have their jump height multiplied with this value. Default jump factor is 1, Honey Blocks use 0.5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `sound(SoundType)`                                    | Sets the block's sound type. The sound type is used when placing, mining or breaking a block. For information on how to get a `SoundType`, please refer to the [Sounds][sounds] section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `lightLevel(ToIntFunction<BlockState>)`               | Sets the block's light level, depending on the blockstate. This is a function to account for blocks like redstone lamps that have a `lit` property. The function must always return a value between 0 and 15 (both inclusive).                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `mapColor(MapColor)`                                  | Sets the block's map color to the given map color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `mapColor(DyeColor)`                                  | Overload of `mapColor` that accepts a `DyeColor`. The `DyeColor` is converted to its corresponding `MapColor` internally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `mapColor(Function<BlockState, MapColor>)`            | Overload of `mapColor` that allows for blockstate-specific `MapColor`s. Used for example by beds, where the head part always uses `MapColor.WOOL`, while the foot part uses the bed's color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `instrument(NoteBlockInstrument)`                     | Sets the block's note block instrument. The instrument is used for a note block placed above the block. A list of valid options can be found in the source code for `NoteBlockInstrument`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `pushReaction(PushReaction)`                          | Sets the block's push reaction. Valid values for entities are `NORMAL` (push and pull), `DESTROY` (destroy when trying to push), `BLOCK` (block against pushing, cannot be pulled; used by hard blocks such as obsidian, as well as blocks that have an inventory), `IGNORE` (used for entites that can't be pushed/pulled, not to be used for blocks) and `PUSH_ONLY` (push, but not pull; used by Glazed Terracotta) |
| `ignitedByLava()`                                     | Enables the block to be ignited when next to lava. Primarily used for wooden blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `randomTicks()`                                       | Enables random ticking for the block. Every tick, a set amount of blocks are selected in each chunk to be randomly ticked. The amount is determined by the `randomTickSpeed` gamerule (default is 3). If a block is selected and random ticking is enabled, then `Block#randomTick` is called for that block.                                                                                                          |
| `noOcclusion()`                                       | Disables occlusion for the block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `noCollission()`                                      | Disables collision **and occlusion** for the block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `dynamicShape()`                                      | Tells the game that the block has a dynamic shape. Used by vanilla in a few cases, such as piston heads or shulker boxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `forceSolidOn()`                                      | ???                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `isValidSpawn(StateArgumentPredicate<EntityType<?>>)` | Sets the block to be a valid spawn for entities that fulfill the given state predicate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `isRedstoneConductor(StatePredicate)`                 | Sets the block to be a redstone conductor if the given state predicate is fulfilled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `isSuffocating(StatePredicate)`                       | Sets the block to suffocate entities inside it if the given state predicate is fulfilled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `isViewBlocking(StatePredicate)`                      | Sets the block to block the view for entities inside it if the given state predicate is fulfilled. Typically used with a predicate that is always `false`, for example by Glass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `hasPostProcess(StatePredicate)`                      | Sets the block to have worldgen post processing if the given state predicate is fulfilled. Always true for Brown Mushrooms, Red Mushrooms and Magma Blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `emissiveRendering(StatePredicate)`                   | Sets the block to have emissive rendering if the given state predicate is fulfilled. True for Magma Blocks and activated Sculk Sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `offsetType(OffsetType)`                              | Sets the block's random position offset type. The random position offset slightly offsets a block's hitbox and model position to make it feel more natural. Has three possible values: `NONE` (default), `XZ` (horizontal) and `XYZ` (all directions). Grass and Ferns use `XYZ`, while many flowers and flower-like blocks use `XZ`.                                                                                  |
| `requiredFeatures(FeatureFlag...)`                    | Sets the block's required feature flags. The block will only be actually registered if all the passed feature flags are activated. Currently unused, but historically used for bamboo and cherry wood (among others) when they were in their experimental phase.                                                                                                                                                       |
