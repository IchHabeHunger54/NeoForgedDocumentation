Method Reference
================

This article is a reference for all protected or public methods in various block-related classes.

`Block`
-------

:::note
Some of these methods are actually located in `BlockBehaviour`, the abstract superclass of `Block`, or in `IForgeBlock`, a NeoForge-added interface implemented by `Block` that adds extra utilities for modders to the `Block` class. However, for all our intents and purposes, we can treat them as if they were located in `Block` itself.

### Static methods

| Method                                          | Description                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `public static Properties of()`                 | Returns a new `Properties` object with default values.                                |
| `public static Properties copy(BlockBehaviour)` | Returns a new `Properties` object with the values used by the given `BlockBehaviour`. |

### Instance methods

All instance methods of `Properties` are `public` and return themselves (`return this;`). As a result, all the below methods can be chained at will; that is, appended in whatever order you like. An example from the `Blocks` class best shows this:
```java
public static final Block OAK_PLANKS = register("oak_planks", new Block(BlockBehaviour.Properties.of()
        .mapColor(MapColor.WOOD)
        .instrument(NoteBlockInstrument.BASS)
        .strength(2.0F, 3.0F)
        .sound(SoundType.WOOD)
        .ignitedByLava()
));
```

| `air()`                                               | Tells the game to consider the block as air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `destroyTime(float)`                                  | Sets the block's destroy time. Default value is 0. Typical values include 1.5 for stone, 0.5 for dirt, 50 for obsidian, and -1 for unbreakable blocks such as bedrock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `explosionResistance(float)`                          | Sets the block's explosion resistance. Default value is 0. Typical values include 6 for stone, 0.5 for dirt, 1200 for obsidian, and 3600000 for unbreakable blocks such as bedrock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `strength(float, float)`                              | Sets the block's destroy time (first parameter) and explosion resistance (second parameter). Equivalent to calling `.destroyTime(float).explosionResistance(float)` with the same parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `strength(float)`                                     | Sets the block's destroy time and explosion resistance. Equivalent to calling `.destroyTime(float).explosionResistance(float)` with the same parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `instabreak()`                                        | Sets the block's destroy time and explosion resistance to 0. Equivalent to calling `.destroyTime(0).explosionResistance(0)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `requiresCorrectToolForDrops()`                       | Sets the block to require the correct tool in order to drop anything. If false, the correct tool will mine faster, but items will drop regardless of what tool was used. `true` for blocks like stone or the various ores, `false` for blocks like planks or dirt.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `noLootTable()`                                       | Sets the block to not use a loot table, causing the block to not drop anything. Note that no drops can also be achieved by using an empty loot table instead of no loot table at all, so only use this where applicable. Vanilla uses include unobtainable blocks (bedrock, barriers, etc.) and fluids (water/lava blocks).                                                                                            |
| `dropsLike(Block)`                                    | **DEPRECATED: Use `lootFrom` instead!** Sets the block to use the given block's loot table instead of its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `lootFrom(Supplier<Block>)`                           | Sets the block to use the given block's loot table instead of its own. Uses a `Supplier` to allow directly passing in `RegistryObject`s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `noParticlesOnBreak()`                                | Disables breaking particles for the block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `replaceable()`                                       | Enables the block to be replaceable by other blocks. This is relevant when trying to place a block into another blocks. For example, grass is replaceable, while flowers are not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `friction(float)`                                     | Sets the block's friction (slipperiness) value. Default friction value is 0.6, Ice, Packed Ice and Frosted Ice use 0.98, Blue Ice uses 0.989, and Slime Blocks use 0.8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `speedFactor(float)`                                  | Sets the block's speed factor. Entities that walk over the block will be slowed (if < 1) or sped up (if > 1) by this value. Default speed factor is 1, Soul Sand and Honey Blocks use 0.4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `jumpFactor(float)`                                   | Sets the block's jump factor. Entities that jump while standing on this block will have their jump height multiplied with this value. Default jump factor is 1, Honey Blocks use 0.5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `sound(SoundType)`                                    | Sets the block's sound type. The sound type is used when placing, mining or breaking a block. For information on how to get a `SoundType`, please refer to the [Sounds][sounds] section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `lightLevel(ToIntFunction<BlockState>)`               | Sets the block's light level, depending on the blockstate. This is a function to account for blocks like redstone lamps that have a `lit` property. The function must always return a value between 0 and 15 (both inclusive).                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `mapColor(MapColor)`                                  | Sets the block's map color to the given map color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `mapColor(DyeColor)`                                  | Overload of `mapColor` that accepts a `DyeColor`. The `DyeColor` is converted to its corresponding `MapColor` internally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `mapColor(Function<BlockState, MapColor>)`            | Overload of `mapColor` that allows for blockstate-specific `MapColor`s. Used for example by beds, where the head part always uses `MapColor.WOOL`, while the foot part uses the bed's color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `instrument(NoteBlockInstrument)`                     | Sets the block's note block instrument. The instrument is used for a note block placed above the block. A list of valid options can be found in the source code for `NoteBlockInstrument`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `pushReaction(PushReaction)`                          | Sets the block's push reaction. Valid values for entities are `NORMAL` (push and pull), `DESTROY` (destroy when trying to push), `BLOCK` (block against pushing, cannot be pulled; used by hard blocks such as obsidian, as well as blocks that have an inventory), `IGNORE` (used for entites that can't be pushed/pulled, not to be used for blocks) and `PUSH_ONLY` (push, but not pull; used by Glazed Terracotta) |
| `ignitedByLava()`                                     | Enables the block to be ignited when next to lava. Primarily used for wooden blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `randomTicks()`                                       | Enables random ticking for the block. Every tick, a set amount of blocks are selected in each chunk to be randomly ticked. The amount is determined by the `randomTickSpeed` gamerule (default is 3). If a block is selected and random ticking is enabled, then `Block#randomTick` is called for that block.                                                                                                          |
| `noOcclusion()`                                       | Disables occlusion for the block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `noCollission()`                                      | Disables collision **and occlusion** for the block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `dynamicShape()`                                      | Tells the game that the block has a dynamic shape. Used by vanilla in a few cases, such as piston heads or shulker boxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `forceSolidOn()`                                      | ???                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `isSuffocating(StatePredicate)`                       | Sets the block to suffocate entities inside it if the given state predicate is fulfilled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `isViewBlocking(StatePredicate)`                      | Sets the block to block the view for entities inside it if the given state predicate is fulfilled. Typically used with a predicate that is always `false`, for example by Glass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `hasPostProcess(StatePredicate)`                      | Sets the block to have worldgen post processing if the given state predicate is fulfilled. Always true for Brown Mushrooms, Red Mushrooms and Magma Blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `emissiveRendering(StatePredicate)`                   | Sets the block to have emissive rendering if the given state predicate is fulfilled. True for Magma Blocks and activated Sculk Sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `offsetType(OffsetType)`                              | Sets the block's random position offset type. The random position offset slightly offsets a block's hitbox and model position to make it feel more natural. Has three possible values: `NONE` (default), `XZ` (horizontal) and `XYZ` (all directions). Grass and Ferns use `XYZ`, while many flowers and flower-like blocks use `XZ`.                                                                                  |
| `requiredFeatures(FeatureFlag...)`                    | Sets the block's required feature flags. The block will only be actually registered if all the passed feature flags are activated. Currently unused, but historically used for bamboo and cherry wood (among others) when they were in their experimental phase.                                                                                                                                                       |
